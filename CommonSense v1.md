CommonSense v1.0.0

CommonSense is a framework for ingesting and processing financial data from the SEC EDGAR database.

The goal of CommonSense is to provide analyst ratings for companies based on their financial data, and recent news offerings

CommonSense will be built using the following technologies:

Python for the backend, ingesting and processing data from the SEC EDGAR database
Ollama for the LLM -> this will be used to generate analyst ratings, and allows the usage of private models (and open source models)

This keeps CommonSense free to use, and allows for minimum maintenance costs.
